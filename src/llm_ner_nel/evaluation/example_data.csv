"us business leaders are spending big on donald trump’s second inaugural fund, which is predicted to exceed even the record-setting $107m raised in 2017 . the donations, which are not restricted by campaign finance laws, come as industries and business leaders seek to curry favor with the incoming administration after the president-elect decisively won a second, non-consecutive term in november . some of the planned donations reportedly include $1m each from jeff bezos’s amazon, openai ceo sam altman and facebook parent company meta, led by mark zuckerberg . hedge-fund manager ken griffin has said he plans to donate $1m, bloomberg reported; uber and its ceo dara khosrowshahi are reported to be chipping in $1m each; and toyota, ford and general motors are each peeling off $1m .  ford is also reportedly coupling its donation with a fleet of vehicles . “everybody wants to be my friend!!!” trump wrote in a post on truth social on thursday . many senior executives in us industries and finance have already made the trip to mar-a-lago, trump’s transition team headquarters, or are planning to, according to reports, as they seek to gain influence and access to the incoming administration that’s threatening to shake up international trading norms . brendan glavin, director of research for the money-in-politics nonprofit opensecrets, told cnbc last week that trump’s inaugural committee presents a “great opportunity for them to curry favor with the incoming administration” . glavin pointed out that courting trump is as much a defensive as a charm-offensive posture .  “none of these people, they don’t want to be trump’s punching bag for four years,” he told the outlet . abc news reported that trump’s second-inauguration haul is on track to shatter the previous $107m record, as pledged contributions have already exceeded a $150m fundraising goal .  barack obama’s inauguration raised $53m in 2009 and $42m in 2013, and joe biden’s raised $63m in 2021 . “one of the oldest adages in washington is that if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu, and the price of admission to have a seat at the table keeps going up,” michael beckel, director of the political reform advocacy group issue one, told the outlet . the wall street journal on tuesday identified 11 companies and trade associations that are supporting trump’s second inauguration despite having pledged to suspend or reconsider political-action committee donations after the 6 january 2021 riot at the us capitol . the journal noted that ford, intuit, toyota and the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america are among the companies that made january 6-related pledges but are now supporting the trump committee . a phrma spokesperson told the outlet that the company had “announced a pause on our giving at the time and then subsequently added new criteria to guide our contributions” . toyota donating $1m to donald trump’s inauguration – reportread morethe journal reported that companies have been advised by political strategists to cleanse their websites and corporate policies of language that favors democrats .  that includes a letter from former stanley black &amp; decker ceo jim loree condemning the capitol attack and vowing that the company would “advocate for our democracy and a peaceful transition of power” . the company is donating $1m to the inaugural fund, a significant increase on the $25,000 it gave to trump in 2017 . trump aides have indicated that the fundraising isn’t about the money but a symbolic means to exact an apology for any previous perceived lapse of loyalty . according to the journal, donors who give $1m or raise $2m will receive six tickets to a series of pre-inauguration events, including a reception with cabinet picks, a “candlelight dinner” with trump and melania trump and a black-tie ball .  this article was amended on 26 december 2024 .  an earlier version mistakenly referred to the “2001”, rather than 2021, riot at the us capitol .","Donald Trump|Melania Trump|Jeff Bezos|Sam Altman|Mark Zuckerberg|Ken Griffin|Dara Khosrowshahi|Brendan Glavin|Michael Beckel|Jim Loree|Barack Obama|Joe Biden|Amazon|OpenAI|Meta|Uber|Toyota|Ford|General Motors|OpenSecrets|Issue One|The Wall Street Journal|Intuit|Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America|Stanley Black & Decker|ABC News|Bloomberg|Donald Trump Second Inaugural Fund|2024 Presidential Election|January 6 Capitol Attack|Mar-a-Lago|Washington D.C.|Truth Social"

"in the days leading up to christmas, stout-lovers were left reeling from a nationwide shortage of guinness so severe that some pubs were forced to ration pints of the “black stuff” as taps began to run dry . supermarkets remain at risk of running out due to customers’ stockpiling, according to reports, while the maker of the popular stout, diageo, has even sent for back-up guinness reserves from ireland . now it can be revealed that criminals appear to have gone to even greater lengths to beat the drought, with a heist that exacerbated the nationwide shortage . a truck carrying 400 50-litre kegs of the irish stout – equivalent to 35,200 pints – disappeared from a depot in the midlands in mid-december, the guardian can reveal . it is understood the truck, whose contents were destined for pubs desperate for kegs of guinness during the festive peak, was stolen from a logistics hub near daventry, in northamptonshire . diageo, which owns guinness, declined to comment on the alleged theft . but sources familiar with the incident confirmed that a subcontractor working for a company in the diageo supply chain had reported the theft to the police . the guardian has approached northamptonshire police for comment but the whereabouts of the purloined guinness is understood to remain a mystery . the guinness shortage has been fuelled by its newfound popularity with gen z, many of whom like to pose, pint in hand, on social media .  diageo, which brews the stout at its st james’s gate brewery in dublin, has intensified its marketing efforts and worked with influencers over the past few years to raise guinness’s profile . the apparent theft continues a spate of recent crimes in which edible delicacies have been pilfered . in december, a michelin-starred chef issued a public appeal to thieves who stole his van containing 2,500 pies to “do the right thing” and give them to people in need . two months earlier, detectives investigating the theft of 22 tonnes of cheese from neal’s yard dairy arrested a 63-year-old man on suspicion of fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods . the london cheese specialist had delivered 950 wheels of cheddar – reported to be worth up to £300,000 – to an alleged fraudster posing as a wholesale distributor for a big french retailer . nor is the great guinness heist of 2024 the first time that thieves have taken advantage of the busy christmas period to scarper with thousands of pints of the ebony nectar . in 2007, a van drove into the st james’s gate brewery, where guinness is made, and escaped with 180 kegs of guinness, 180 kegs of budweiser and 90 kegs of carlsberg, the equivalent of 40,000 pints, also in the run-up to christmas .  this article was amended on 31 december 2024 .  the original version said 400 kegs contained about 20,000 pints .  the true figure (for 50-litre kegs) is 35,200 pints."," Diageo|Guinness|St James’s Gate Brewery|The Guardian|Northamptonshire Police|Neal’s Yard Dairy|French Retailer|Michelin-Starred Chef|63-Year-Old Man|Ireland|Dublin|Midlands|Daventry|Northamptonshire|2024 Guinness Heist|2007 Guinness Heist|Guinness Shortage|Cheese Theft|Pie Theft|Generation Z|Influencers|Guinness|Budweiser|Carlsberg|Cheddar Cheese|Pies"
"emmanuel macron, the french president, has warned donald trump against a “surrender” of ukraine as the us president said russia’s leader vladimir putin “wants to make a deal” that could include european peacekeepers . the transatlantic rift over the war was apparent on monday as trump and macron – the first european leader to visit the white house since trump regained power – disagreed over aid and efforts to secure a lasting peace in ukraine . the meeting was cordial, at times even warm, but came just hours after the us voted against a united nations resolution drafted by ukraine and the european union condemning russia for its invasion . un general assembly backs resolution condemning russia for ukraine warread moretrump, who last week branded ukraine’s volodymyr zelenskyy a “dictator” and falsely blamed ukraine for starting the war, told reporters in the oval office that putin would accept european peacekeepers in ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year conflict . trump said he saw no objection to such a move, adding that he had raised the idea with putin .  “yeah, he will accept it,” the us president said .  “i’ve asked him that question . “look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war .  he doesn’t mind .  but i’ve specifically asked him that question .  he has no problem with it . ”later, at a joint press conference in the east room, trump touted his team’s positive conversations with russia .  “before i came here there was no communication with russia whatsoever and russia wasn’t answering calls .  they were not talking to anybody and people accepted that . “but when i got here one of the first calls i made was to president putin and we were treated with great respect and they want to end this war, so that’s a big thing . ”he added: “i really believe that he wants to make a deal .  i may be wrong, but he wants to make a deal . ”the us president claimed he had made more progress in the past month than was made in the previous three years .  “i believe that emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues,” he said .  “europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of ukraine . ”macron acknowledged that he and trump had “made very substantive steps forward” in their discussion .  but he pointedly described russia as the “aggressor” in ukraine and was appreciably more cautious . he told reporters: “this peace must not mean a surrender of ukraine .  it must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees .  this peace must allow for ukrainian sovereignty and allow ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders . ”the french president added: “i think it’s super important to go to the peace .  but my strong point was to say, let’s try to get something first which can be assessed, checked and verified … we want peace swiftly but we don’t want an agreement that is weak . ”earlier, the pair clashed directly when trump made false claims about the funding of the war .  he said: “just so you understand, europe is loaning the money to ukraine .  they’re getting their money back . ”macron leaned over to touch trump’s arm and interjected: “no, in fact, to be frank, we paid .  we paid 60% of the total effort .  it was like the us: loans, guarantees, grants . ”trump responded: “if you believe that, it’s ok with me .  they get their money back, and we don’t .  but now we do . ”trump and his team have been negotiating a minerals revenue-sharing agreement with ukraine to recoup some of the money that the previous administration had sent to kyiv to repel russia . trump described the minerals deal as “very close” and said he might meet zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement .  “he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement, which would be nice,” trump said, adding that he would also be meeting putin at some point . zelenskyy last week rejected us demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from ukraine to repay washington for wartime aid, contending that the us had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement . asked if ukraine should be willing to cede territory to russia as part of a negotiated end to the conflict, trump said: “we’ll see,” and noted that talks were just beginning . in an interview with fox news after his visit with trump, macron said a truce between ukraine and russia “could be done in the weeks to come” .  he also praised zelenskyy’s leadership and said it was crucial for trump to meet with the ukrainian president . 1:42macron says truce between ukraine and russia 'could be done in the weeks to come' – videomeanwhile, putin on monday signalled that he was not opposed to europe’s involvement in the talks .  in a televised interview reported by agence france-presse, the russian president said: “not only european [countries] but other countries too have the right and can take part . ”the british prime minister, keir starmer, is to visit trump later in the week, amid alarm in europe over trump’s hardening stance toward ukraine and overtures to moscow on the three-year-old conflict . that alarm deepened on monday as the un security council on monday adopted a us-drafted resolution that takes a more conciliatory position towards russia .  previously, the 15-member body had been deadlocked because russia holds a veto . france, britain, denmark, greece and slovenia abstained .  russia voted in favour after failing to amend it and vetoing european bids to add language supporting ukraine . the us voted against a separate, europe-backed un general assembly resolution condemning russia’s invasion of ukraine, siding with north korea, belarus and other russia-aligned countries over european allies . sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator who co-led a bipartisan delegation to the recent munich security conference, said: “this vote is a disgrace .  trump’s senseless betrayal of the alliances that have kept americans safe since world war two and his fealty to the murderous aggressor putin are a national security threat . ”​ this footnote was added on 27 february 2025 to record that an earlier version of the article – describing emmanuel macron as the first european leader to visit donald trump since the latter regained power in january – was later corrected to say macron was the first such leader to pay a white house visit .

"in the absence of action, politicians can only be judged on their words .  this is the perennial problem for opposition parties – how to persuade voters of your fitness to govern without access to levers of power .  it is a challenge that is defeating kemi badenoch . the conservative leader has said little of substance .  her stances, so far, are all reactive gestures .  she has committed to reversing some of labour’s tax-and-spend decisions .  she is demanding a public inquiry into historical child abuse cases on the grounds that previous inquiries failed to “expose those who turned a&nbsp;blind eye to grooming gangs” . this is not a serious programme .  naturally the opposition disagrees with the government and says it would do things differently .  but the conservatives were expelled from office less than six months ago .  the choices labour is making are, in many ways, clearing up the dismal legacy bequeathed by the outgoing administration .  if mrs badenoch doesn’t like the way that the chancellor, rachel reeves, plugs gaps in the budget then she should identify better ways, and show contrition on behalf of her party for leaving the exchequer in such a mess . as for child abuse, the tory leader’s fixation on this issue does not follow any compelling evidence of deficiencies in previous inquiries .  the more obvious motive is new salience that allegations of a cover-up have acquired in radical rightwing circles online, amplified by the world’s richest man, elon musk . mrs badenoch’s argument owes more to crackpot conspiracy theory than statecraft .  she claims police, local authorities and politicians “colluded” to shield grooming gangs, yet did not raise this while in cabinet .  if such a conspiracy did occur, renewed investigation of it could surely have begun when the tories were still in government .  yet mrs&nbsp;badenoch apparently remained silent on the issue as a minister .  her newfound campaigning zeal looks confected and cynical . the same can be said of robert jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, whose sudden, ardent interest in this topic is couched in terms that would not be out of place in far-right propaganda .  mr&nbsp;jenrick asserts that the rule of law was suspended to allow men of british pakistani origin to commit crimes with impunity, and that the root problem is a policy of “importing hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures, who possess medieval attitudes to women” . that is not the language of a politician who is interested in representing modern britain in its full diversity or who cares whether his interventions stoke inter-communal tension and race hatred .  since mrs badenoch stands by her shadow justice secretary it must be assumed that she, too, recognises no threshold of responsible discourse .  or that she lacks the courage to discipline a former leadership rival .  either way, she looks weak and her&nbsp;judgment is poor . even as grubby opportunism, mrs badenoch’s method is misguided .  the tories lost more seats to the liberal democrats than to reform last year .  a poll revival does not go by way of increasingly fanatical adventures in digitally enhanced, racially aggravated paranoia .  beyond electoral strategy, the opposition leader has a constitutional duty to challenge the government without degrading the political process .  the last conservative government set a low bar for looking competent and credible, yet still mrs badenoch cannot clear it", "Kemi Badenoch|Conservative Party|Labour Party|Rachel Reeves|Chancellor of the Exchequer|Elon Musk|Robert Jenrick|Shadow Justice Secretary|British Pakistani|Liberal Democrats|Reform Party|Tory Party|Opposition Leader|Government|Parliament|Cabinet|Police|Local Authorities|Grooming Gangs|Public Inquiry|Historical Child Abuse|Child Abuse Inquiries|Exchequer|Far-right|Radical Rightwing Circles|Modern Britain|Conservative Government|Labour Government|British Politics|Voters|Politicians|Opposition Parties|Electoral Strategy|Constitution|Political Process|Leadership Rival|Digital Propaganda|Race Hatred|Inter-communal Tension|Tax-and-Spend Decisions|Budget|Legacy Administration|Chancellor|Minister"
